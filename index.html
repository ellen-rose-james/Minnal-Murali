        <em><strong>Minnal Murali</strong> (transl.Lightning Murali)</em> is a
        2021 Indian Malayalam-language superhero film directed by Basil Joseph
        and produced by Sophia Paul, under the banner of Weekend Blockbusters.
        The script has been written by Arun Anirudhan and Justin Mathew. The
        film stars Tovino Thomas and Guru Somasundaram, and follows the life of
        Jaison (Tovino Thomas), a young tailor who gains superpowers after being
        struck by lightning, and transforms into a superhero. <br /><br />
        The film was formally announced in January 2019, but due to the
        extensive pre-production works, the film's principal photography took
        place during December 2019. Though shooting got disrupted twice
        following the two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and the vandalism of a
        church set by right-wing groups, the makers managed to complete the
        shoot within July 2021. The film was predominantly shot in Kerala, with
        few sequences being shot at Hassan in Karnataka. The music of the film
        was composed by Shaan Rahman and Sushin Shyam, with Shyam also composing
        the background score, whereas cinematography of the film was handled by
        Sameer Thahir and editing done by Livingston Mathew. <br /><br />
        The film was set for a theatrical release in late-2020, but was
        postponed multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In September
        2021, the makers announced that the film will be released directly
        through the streaming platform Netflix, as a result of closure of
        theatres due to the pandemic. It was premiered at the Mumbai Film
        Festival on 16 December, and was premiered worldwide on the occasion of
        Christmas Eve (24 December 2021).[2][3] It received critical acclaim
        praising the performances, especially Tovino Thomas and Guru
        Somasundaram, story, direction, action sequences, visual effects, climax
        and the music, with many critics calling it the "best superhero film of
        India".

    <h3>Plot</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Jaison, a young tailor from the village of Kurukkanmoola, dreams of
      building a career in the United States. Sub-Inspector of police Saajan
      forbids Jaison to date his daughter Bincy, with who Jaison is in a
      relationship with, and tells him that she is already engaged to Aneesh.
      Aneesh's ex-girlfriend "Bruce Lee" Biji is also angry that Aneesh had
      broken up with her. Meanwhile, Shibu is a social outcast who works in a
      teashop. Shibu is obsessed with Usha, the sister of Daasan who works in
      Jaison's father's tailor shop, to the point of stalking her regularly.
      <br /><br />
      Usha has a daughter, who needs an urgent medical operation but Usha does
      not have the money to pay for the operation. On Christmas Eve, a lightning
      bolt simultaneously strikes Jaison, who is arguing with Saajan, and Shibu,
      who is stalking Usha. Jaison is rushed to the hospital, where doctor
      Sambhashivan treats him, but to everyone's surprise, he is seemingly
      unharmed. <br /><br />In the following days, Jaison and Shibu show signs
      of superpowers. Jaison's nephew, Josemon, comes to the conclusion that
      Jaison gained superpowers after being hit by the lightning. One day,
      Jaison's brother-in-law Constable Siby Pothan gets into a fight with his
      wife because she gave her jewelry to jaison for applying for visa of U.S.
      Enraged by this, Jaison pushes Pothan and the latter falls into a well and
      everyone present is shocked by his strength. Usha comes to Shibu's teashop
      where the owner makes a move on Usha. Shibu is enraged and threatens him
      with his new telekinetic powers, asking him to stay away from her.
      Meanwhile, Jaison's plans to go to the United States come to an unexpected
      halt after his passport verification doesn't go through after Saajan
      meddles with it. <br /><br />Saajan reveals that Varkey is not Jaison's
      real father. Jaison's real father is Martin, an actor who died while
      Jaison was young when the set of the village play caught fire. Varkey saw
      the young Jaison and felt pity for him, raising Jaison as his own son. In
      the present, Jaison is heartbroken after hearing the news. Varkey tells
      Jaison that he didn't reveal the truth earlier as he feared that Jaison
      would abandon him and told him that his father helped everyone in the
      village and died for the sake of village. Jaison realizes that Saajan had
      hit Varkey. Jaison is enraged and with the help of Josemon, disguises
      himself with a mask and goes to Josemon's school's anniversary where many
      policemen, including Saajan, are present as the security for chief gust at
      function. <br /><br />Jaison, wearing the costume, attacks the policemen.
      He writes the name Minnal Murali on the front curtain of the stage the
      anniversary event was held, named after a character in Martin's unfinished
      play. Meanwhile, Usha's daughter faints and is taken to the hospital. The
      doctor tells Usha that her daughter needs to start the operation on her
      now or else she might die. Shibu arrives and tells the doctor that he will
      pay for the operation. To acquire the money, Shibu also wears a mask and
      robs the local bank as Jaison attacks the policemen, pinning this incident
      on 'Minnal Murali'. <br /><br />When Shibu gives the money to the
      hospital, the doctor tells that Daasan had already paid for it. Meanwhile,
      Pothan finds out that Jaison is 'Minnal Murali', but Saajan does not
      believe him. Jaison had been saving money that was given by his sister for
      applying for visa, keeping it in his tailor shop, but it has disappeared
      the same day. Jaison realizes that Daasan had stolen the money for the
      operation. Jaison aggressively confronts Daasan and gives him a deadline
      to give him the money back before that evening. Meanwhile, Usha slowly
      warms up to Shibu but Daasan rejects him. Jaison realizes his mistake and
      goes to Daasan to apologize. Shibu comes to Jaison's store and accused
      Daasan of being the obstacle between his and Usha's relationship. Shibu
      burns down the store, killing Daasan, and then once again blames 'Minnal
      Murali' for the crime. <br /><br />Jaison reveals to Biji that he is
      'Minnal Murali'. Biji and Josemon decide to help Jaison prove to the
      villagers that he is not the one who robbed the bank and killed Daasan
      while also finding the imposter. The police and Jaison view footage of the
      store, the night Daasan died, at the police station to see the identity of
      'Minnal Murali,' but the power goes out the exact moment they are about to
      find Shibu. Shibu, wearing a mask, ambushes the police station in an
      attempt to destroy the video record, the only evidence to show that he is
      the impostor, but Jaison as 'Minnal Murali' attacks him and steals the
      Video Cassette. Jaison and Shibu take their fight to a bus, where Shibu
      bests Jaison due to him having telekinesis, which Jaison does not have.
      Shibu destroys the cassette and escapes. However, in the altercation, the
      bus driver hits his head and dies, which leads to the bus not stopping
      before reaching the edge of a cliff, dangling precariously off of it, but
      Jaison saves the bus, which gains him a few villagers' respect. Jaison and
      Shibu start investigating and they find out each other's identity.
      <br /><br />Saajan and the police force arrive to arrest Shibu as they
      found out that Shibu is the impersonator but Shibu scares them away.
      Pothan finds a picture with 'Minnal Murali' in it and shows it to Saajan.
      Saajan believes Pothan's findings and arrests Jaison. Usha comes to
      Shibu's house and realizes Shibu's love for her and reciprocates it. Shibu
      sees a mob outside his home and tries to stop them, but unknown to Shibu,
      his house slowly catches on fire. A barrel full of firecrackers catch
      fire, causing his house to explode, killing Usha and her daughter and
      injuring Shibu. A grief-stricken and now-psychotic Shibu, goes to a church
      and kills many people while trapping many others, including Josemon,
      planning to burn them alive for revenge. The police is alerted about the
      situation, and Saajan leaves Jaison as he realizes that Jaison is the only
      one who can stop Shibu. Jaison wears a supersuit, goes to the church, and
      confronts Shibu. Jaison succumbs to Shibu's telekinesis once again, but
      Jaison has second wind after remembering his father and his sacrifice for
      the village and villagers, awakening his own telekinesis powers.
      <br /><br />Jaison and Shibu clash again, ending in Jaison impaling Shibu
      with a prop spear, killing Shibu instantly. While saddened over his death,
      Jaison finally gets appreciation from the villagers while Biji puts out
      the fire. The film ends with Jaison telling the audience that many more
      villains will come in the future, but 'Minnal Murali' will be there to
      protect the villagers.
